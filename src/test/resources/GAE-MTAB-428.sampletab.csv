Submission Title	Dietary zinc modulation of cancer-related inflammation genes and esophageal tumor development and prevention in rats																																						
Submission Identifier	GAE-MTAB-428																																						
Submission Description	Weaning male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 dietary groups to form the Zn-deficient (ZD) and Zn-sufficient (ZS) groups. After 5 weeks, the animals received intragastrically, their 1st N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine dose (NMBA, an esophagus carcinogen) at 2 mg/kg body weight. Immediately after NMBA treatment, half of the ZD rats were switched to a ZS diet to form the Zn-replenished (ZR) group, the other half of ZD rats and ZS rats continued on their respective diets. Five weeks after the 1st NMBA dose, 8 ZD, 8 ZR, and 8 ZS rats were sacrificed gene expression profiling and related studies. The remaining rats received their 2nd and 3rd NMBA dose at 6 weeks and 12 weeks after the 1st NMBA dose. At 15 weeks (endpoint) after the 1st NMBA dose, all animals were sacrificed for tumor incidence analysis and gene expression profiling studies. In this study, ZD rats documented a significantly higher tumorigenic outcome than control ZS rats (tumor incidence, ZD vs ZS: 100% vs 16.6%; tumor multiplicity, 11 ± 3.8 vs 0.5 ± 0.3, P<0.001). Replenishing zinc after the first NMBA dose led to a significantly reduced tumor incidence and multiplicity in ZR vs ZD rats (incidence, 28.9% vs 100%; multiplicity, 0.6 ± 0.4 vs 11 ± 3.8, P<0.001). Expression profiling of esophageal epithelia from NMBA-treated ZD, ZR, and control ZS rats (n=4/group) was performed at 5 weeks and at 15 weeks after the 1st carcinogen dose, using Rat Genome 230 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA)

At 15 weeks (endpoint) after the 1st NMBA dose, all animals were sacrificed for tumor incidence analysis and gene expression profiling studies. In this study, ZD rats documented a significantly higher tumorigenic outcome than control ZS rats (tumor incidence, ZD vs ZS: 100% vs 16.6%; tumor multiplicity, 11 ± 3.8 vs 0.5 ± 0.3, P<0.001). Replenishing zinc after the first NMBA dose led to a significantly reduced tumor incidence and multiplicity in ZR vs ZD rats (incidence, 28.9% vs 100%; multiplicity, 0.6 ± 0.4 vs 11 ± 3.8, P<0.001).
